    <p>
  This is a personal <strong class="highlight">Arduino project</strong> I created using an 
  <strong class="highlight">UNO board</strong>, a <strong class="highlight">DHT11 sensor</strong>,
  and a <strong class="highlight">4-pin I2C LCD display</strong>. The goal was to build a reliable system that
  displays <strong class="highlight">real-time temperature</strong> and <strong class="highlight">humidity</strong> values directly from environmental readings.

  <br><br>
  I used this setup to identify areas in my home where the <strong class="highlight">air conditioning and heating</strong>
  seemed to be the most <strong class="highlight">inefficient</strong>. I placed the sensor in different rooms and observed the output over time. 

  <br><br>
  After logging data, I found that the <strong class="highlight">top main bedroom</strong> and the <strong class="highlight">far bedroom</strong> were the least effective
  in terms of airflow and temperature balance. On the other hand, the <strong class="highlight">powder bathroom</strong> had the most consistent output,
  likely because it‚Äôs closest to the <strong class="highlight">AC unit</strong> and main <strong class="highlight">vent connections</strong>.

  <br><br>
  This project taught me how hardware can help identify practical energy inefficiencies, and how sensors can guide real-world optimizations in comfort and energy usage.

        This <strong class="highlight">Tetris replica</strong> was built using an
        <strong class="highlight">Arduino UNO</strong>, an <strong class="highlight">LED matrix</strong>,
        and a <strong class="highlight">2-axis joystick</strong> as a controller.

        <br><br>
        I wanted to challenge myself to recreate a playable version of a classic arcade game,
        but with <strong class="highlight">physical controls</strong> instead of a screen interface. I programmed the
        falling blocks, collision detection, row clearing, and game-over logic entirely in Arduino C++.

        <br><br>
        The joystick is used to move and rotate the blocks, and the LED matrix updates the display in real time.
        Later, I experimented with sharing scores online through a serial link to display rankings.

        <br><br>
        This project taught me about handling timing loops, hardware synchronization, and interactive design.
        I learned how important it is to plan the game logic, optimize the refresh rate, and make it feel responsive.

      <p>
  During my volunteer research work at the University of Waterloo, I helped test and collect data on various types of soil under different stress conditions. This work is crucial for <strong class="highlight">understanding how soil reacts to pressure</strong>, especially when <strong class="highlight">wires, pipes, or structural supports</strong> are laid underground. If we don‚Äôt know how much <strong class="highlight">load-bearing capacity</strong> a soil type can handle, underground systems can shift, collapse, or cause uneven foundation settling.

  We used equipment to <strong class="highlight">simulate pressure conditions</strong> on different soil shapes (cylindrical, square) and types (clay, sand, silt), and then processed the resulting data using <strong class="highlight">MATLAB</strong> to plot load-versus-deflection graphs.

  The insights I gained helped me understand the real-world relevance of <strong class="highlight">geotechnical engineering</strong>, and how civil planning must account for natural terrain and failure risk ‚Äî especially in urban development and infrastructure planning. This opportunity built my <strong class="highlight">analytical and practical skills</strong> through over <strong class="highlight">50+ hours of engineering exposure</strong>.

      <p>
  Volunteering at the KW Humane Society has been a deeply fulfilling experience where I learned not only the basics of animal care but the <strong class="highlight">critical role volunteers play</strong> in keeping the shelter running. Every Friday for a 2-hour shift, I help clean kennels, feed animals, and walk dogs ‚Äî while ensuring they receive the attention and care they deserve.

  Volunteers form the backbone of animal shelters. Without them, the workload on limited staff would overwhelm the system, leading to <strong class="highlight">reduced animal welfare, limited adoptions</strong>, and slower rehabilitation. My involvement has helped me build <strong class="highlight">empathy, responsibility</strong>, and a passion for improving the lives of rescue animals.

  Through this experience (<strong class="highlight">10+ hours</strong> so far), I‚Äôve come to recognize how much these animals rely on <strong class="highlight">kindness, consistency</strong>, and <strong class="highlight">community involvement</strong>. Being part of their journey to adoption makes every hour worthwhile.

      <p>
  I train six days a week following a structured <strong class="highlight">Push Pull Legs (PPL)</strong> split to maximize strength, muscle recovery, and discipline. This method aligns with scientifically-supported programming by allowing muscle groups to <strong class="highlight">recover optimally between sessions</strong>.

  - <strong class="highlight">Push</strong> ‚Äî Chest, Shoulders, Triceps  
  - <strong class="highlight">Pull</strong> ‚Äî Back, Biceps, Forearms  
  - <strong class="highlight">Legs</strong> ‚Äî Quads, Hamstrings, Calves, Core  

  PPL splits are ideal for <strong class="highlight">progressive overload</strong> ‚Äî increasing resistance over time to build strength. I pair this with <strong class="highlight">compound lifts</strong> like bench press, rows, squats, and overhead press, targeting major muscle groups efficiently.

  Strength-based training also promotes <strong class="highlight">neural efficiency</strong>, tendon resilience, and body composition improvements. It's not just about aesthetics ‚Äî it‚Äôs about building long-term <strong class="highlight">health, grit, and mental toughness</strong> through consistent effort and measurable growth.
