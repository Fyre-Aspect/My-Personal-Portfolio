              <p>
                Each experience represents a different facet of growth - from <span className="page-highlight">technical precision</span> in research labs 
                to <span className="page-highlight">split-second decision-making</span> on sports courts. This diversity of experiences creates a 
                <span className="page-highlight">well-rounded foundation</span> for tackling complex challenges and adapting to new environments. 
                As a student committed to <span className="page-highlight">continuous learning</span>, I actively seek opportunities that push me 
                outside my comfort zone and expand my <span className="page-highlight">skill set</span>.

                <p>
                  With over <span className="page-highlight">500+ hours</span> invested across these diverse activities, I've learned that 
                  growth comes from embracing variety. Each new challenge - whether mastering a <span className="page-highlight">flute piece</span>, 
                  organizing complex <span className="page-highlight">filing systems</span>, or developing <span className="page-highlight">emergency response skills</span> - 
                  adds another tool to my problem-solving toolkit. This breadth of experience makes me a more 
                  <span className="page-highlight">adaptable</span>, <span className="page-highlight">resilient</span>, and 
                  <span className="page-highlight">collaborative</span> student ready to tackle whatever comes next.
